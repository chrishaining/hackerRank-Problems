//the task is to create a function that takes an array as an argument and calculates the difference between the sums of the diagonals. This means that the array is actually a square 2-D matrix. The function should then return/log the difference.
//step 1 is to work out the number of rows, based on the length of the array.
//step 2 is to make sure the items in the array go into the correct slots. I want to have a way to identify each item's position within the matrix.
//step 3 is to sum the first diagonal. This will start at the first item (I'll assume that's index 0) and end at the last item (I think JavaScript has a method .lastIndexOf()). The number of intermediary positions depends on the length of the array.
//step 4 is to sum the second diagonal.
//step 5 is to subtract first diagonal sum from second diagonal sum
// SHOULD I BE CREATING ARRAYS FOR EACH ROW?
